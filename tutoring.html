<p>Since graduating from Harvard at age 19, Milo has dedicated himself to his lifelong passion of teaching math. He has taught students on three continents, from 3rd grade to graduate school, as well as developed innovative custom curriculum materials for organizations and private clients. His book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609844/math-without-numbers-by-milo-beckman/"><i>Math Without Numbers</i></a> (2021) was published by Penguin Random House and has since been translated into 17 languages. Previously, he attended Stuyvesant High School and captained the New York City Math Team at age 13.</p>

<p>Milo's teaching style is warm and conversational, prioritizing common sense and mathematical intuition over rote memorization, to help students unlock their inner math genius. While Milo can guide students of all backgrounds over any mathematical hurdle, his speciality is empowering bright and motivated students to achieve academic excellence in challenging honors sequences such as Exeter Math or Dalton's notorious "2A" program. Milo also offers bespoke math enrichment sessions for talented students looking to stand out on college apps with a math contest or research paper.</p>

<p>Outside of tutoring, Milo enjoys writing and reading, solving and constructing crossword puzzles, playing piano and guitar, traveling, rock climbing, and learning new things. </p></br>
