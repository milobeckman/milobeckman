<p>I collaborated with Jackson Maslow to make a word game for iPhone called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1372594090">werd</a>. It's like a crossword sudoku -- it starts out partially filled in and there's a unique solution for each puzzle. Three difficulties plus a fourth hidden one, for 40,000 puzzles in total.</p>

<p>Coming to Android probably never (coding is hard).</p>


<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><table style="margin:auto; width:70%"><tr><th>
<img src="[[ASSET]]werd1.png" style="width:80%"></th><th>
<img src="[[ASSET]]werd2.png" style="width:80%"></th><th>
<img src="[[ASSET]]werd3.png" style="width:80%"></th></tr>
</table></p>

<p>I wrote a Python script to automatically generate the puzzles, and Jackson and I wrote the app in Swift. We spent $99 submitting to the app store and have no plans to monetize the app so please download and let us know what you think! It's very much still in beta so email me if you find a bug or an unsolvable puzzle: <a href="mailto:milobeckman@gmail.com">milobeckman@gmail.com</a>. Enjoy and maybe leave a rating if you feel like it!</p>
