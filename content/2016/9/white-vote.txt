<p>My <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/religion-and-education-explain-the-white-vote/">new piece</a> on FiveThirtyEight asks this question. Voters of color, of course, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/20/three-in-four-voters-of-color-strongly-dislike-trump/">decided resoundingly against</a> Trump.</p>

<p>It's not central to the piece, but this is a significant point:</p>

<p class="quote">Republican ideology seems to be aligned with the values taught in historically white churches: For instance, black and Hispanic members of interracial congregations hold the same <a href="http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/28/socrel.sru067">individualistic social attitudes</a> as white churchgoers, suggesting that they may adopt these conservative views after extended exposure to white church values.</p>

<p>The linked study is to me an elegant demonstration of institutional inertia: values/practices remain largely stable, despite personnel changes. Consider this in conjunction with the fact that most of America's interracial institutions are historically white â€” black churches, schools, and neighborhoods have not been integrated.</p>
