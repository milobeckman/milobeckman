<p>The DNC (~1963-present) has been the most consequential force for domestic progressive change in recent American history.</p>

<p>Agents of the DNC have passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)">Medicare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965">Voting Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Affordable Care Act</a>; have raised taxes on corporate and personal income. These actions have changed the allocation of resources in a real sense, from the wealthy to the disadvantaged, particularly people of color.</p> 

<p>These changes were prompted by, and would not have happened without, activists. But they also would not have happened without institutional actors generally amenable to the activists' ideals. The DNC is responsive to these activists (for whatever reasons, even if it's just for votes) and -- crucially -- they work to develop realistic policies that will address their concerns. These policies are often seen as "incrementalist" especially by the activists who pushed for them, but this is precisely how progressive change has happened in every historical example.</p>

<p>The DNC certainly has problems, but they are more a result of the ecosystem in which the DNC exists than they are specific to the DNC. For example, the DNC is funded by an assortment of interest groups and wealthy donors. This is a feature of the party/election process: if the DNC declined funding from interest groups and wealthy donors, it would lose every election and soon be supplanted by a party that accepted this funding.</p>

<p>How, then, do we change these system-level problems? It's awfully easy to come along and say "this is fucked, right?" It's much harder to come up with workable solutions. We can say "campaign finance reform," but what does that mean? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_elections">Public election funding</a>? <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/donor-diversity-through-public-matching-funds">Small donor matching</a>? These are good, workable solutions -- and they're supported by DNC politicians.</p>

<p><mark>You change system-level problems by supporting those institutional actors (yes, within that problematic system) who support the same changes as you.</mark> Attacking institutions for responding appropriately to systemic incentives -- especially when those institutions are working to change the systemic incentives -- is actively counterproductive.</p>

<p>Essentially, we should measure the DNC (really, we should measure everything) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement">value above replacement</a>. The alternative to the DNC isn't some magical Standing Rockâ€“Black Lives Matter party with no corporate allies. It's the RNC.</p>
