<p>(All, for obvious reasons, election-themed.)</p>

<p>The short read, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/800016844417593345">a paragraph on censorship in the 21st century</a> by Zeynep Tufekci.</p>

<p class="quote">Think of attention as a resource ... and censorship as a broad term for denial of attention through multiple means, including but not limited to the traditional definition of censorship as efforts to actively block information from getting out.</p>

<p>The medium read, <a href="http://farai.com/the-call-to-whiteness/">an essay on the politics of whiteness</a> by Farai Chideya.</p>

<p class="quote">In retrospect, I realize ... how unwilling I and we were as journalists to foreground this clash over the nationalist call-to-whiteness as part of the political narrative. This horrified mother was staring white nationalism in the face, and it was staring back at her.</p>

<p class="quote">There has been a concerted effort — covert, overt, or both — to keep the narrative of white nationalism, including its violence and extralegal workings — out of the American eye. Much of it, I believe, comes from the inability of media and of many individuals to ascribe racial/group characteristics to whiteness.</p>

<p class="quote">I am rejecting ... the idea that my excellence and self-improvement is a blood price I must pay to prove black Americans’ worthiness of a true meritocracy. You either believe in working toward a true meritocracy or you do not, and I will not bribe you into belief by my individual performance. Are you for equality, or are you not?</p>

<p>The long read, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency">a feature on Obama's thoughts after the election</a> by David Remnick.</p>

<p class="quote">“People are complicated,” Obama told me. “Societies and cultures are really complicated. . . . This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms, and it’s messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding. And you should anticipate that at any given moment there’s going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn’t stop. . . . You don’t get into a fetal position about it. You don’t start worrying about apocalypse. You say, O.K., where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward.”</p>

<p>All are excellent pieces of writing and worth your time.</p>
