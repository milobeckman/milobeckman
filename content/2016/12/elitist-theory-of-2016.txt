<p>Coastal educated elites don't like being seen as coastal educated elites. When asked to explain why education is <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/">highly correlated with Clinton support</a> (among white voters) we suggest an assortment of evenhanded theories. Maybe it's about media consumption habits. Maybe it's about cultural hegemony. Even when we suggest that it's about, well, education, there's some hedging:</p>

<p class="quote">Trump’s approach to the campaign — relying on emotional appeals while glossing over policy details — may have resonated more among people with lower education levels as compared with Clinton’s wonkier and more cerebral approach.</p>

<p>(That is from Nate Silver, linked above.)</p>

<p>Let me be more blunt:</p>

<p><mark>Maybe education is correlated with Clinton support because the world takes some explaining.</mark></p>

<p>American lore teaches us from an early age that we live in a meritocracy — that if you work hard, you will get ahead. At the same time, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in poverty. The default response, if you don't know any better, is to assume they have less to offer, or that they are less motivated.</p>

<p>The overwhelming weight of empirical evidence, of course, points to institutional explanations — a long and ongoing history of legal, economic, social, cultural, and political exclusion and oppression. Each study makes up a single pixel of the broader picture. There is no four-word slogan. It can't be tweeted.</p>

<p>But there is broad academic consensus on this point. The debate has been closed. When a politician strays from this consensus, they are shunned — not to preserve some "politically correct" worldview, but because they are wrong.</p>

<p>At no point, though, did we share this knowledge with the non-college-educated public. They feel that their beliefs are shunned, and they dig in their heels. We shun them more. They elect a proud know-nothing who learns from internet messageboards and traffics in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>We need to do better. <mark>Stigmatizing ignorance is an extremely ineffective way to educate people.</mark></p>
