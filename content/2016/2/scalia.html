                            <p>When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away last Saturday, political commentators wasted little time on eulogies. And while the influential jurist certainly deserves a moment of memorializing, the press can hardly be faulted for focusing on his successor. The battle currently raging over Scalia’s replacement will have an impact on American democracy lasting decades beyond his death.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html">actuarial tables</a> (that is, death statistics) to build a Supreme Court tenure simulator. Each run of the simulation plays out one possible future, with each justice having a probability of dying each year in accordance with his/her age and gender. For example, if Stephen Breyer lives to see 2030, he will, as a 92-year-old man, have a 20.5% chance of passing away that year.</p>

<p>(Please excuse the callousness with which I discuss the potential deaths of these esteemed public figures. Bear in mind that these simulations are purely hypothetical, that similarly inglorious methods are used to price life insurance, and that, hey, we’re all gonna die someday. Take a deep breath and keep reading.)</p>

<p>I made some generous assumptions to simplify calculations. If you just want to get to the graphs, scroll past this section. But if you’re a technicalities geek, here they are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Each justice is either liberal or conservative, and stays that way.</b> Justices actually get <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/supreme-court-justices-get-more-liberal-as-they-get-older/">more liberal over time</a>, but this is a fair approximation.</li>
<li><b>Democratic presidents appoint liberal justices; Republican presidents appoint conservative justices.</b> This isn’t quite what our founding fathers intended, but it’s <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12132">empirically true.</a></li>
<li><b>The presidency is a coin flip every four years.</b> There’s an advantage for incumbent presidents, but this is actually <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/the-white-house-is-not-a-metronome/">closer to true than you may think.</a></li>
<li><b>Justices have the same death rates as average Americans.</b> This definitely isn’t true. Justices are richer, whiter, and better educated than average Americans—so they should live longer. But hopefully this effect cancels out with...</li>
<li><b>Justices only leave the Court when they die.</b> This is also not true, since plenty retire or resign. One could imagine, though, that justices leave the court at around the same age that average Americans die.</li>
<li><b>New appointees are 55 years old on average, with a standard deviation of 5.</b> This is roughly based on <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/17/11032182/pope-president-and-justice-ages">historical data</a>.</li>
<li><b>New appointees are equally likely to be male or female.</b> This is quite a stretch. More on this later.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using these rules, I ran 30,000 simulations per year and recorded what fraction of them had a liberal majority. That’s how I got that graph up top, which I’ll reprint here:</p>

<img src="http://milobeckman.github.io/content/2016/2/scalia-1.png">

<p>If Scalia hadn’t died this year (the line in gray), the Court was conservative and likely to remain that way. As late as 2020, there was only a 33% chance of a liberal majority—this would require another Democratic president as well as a conservative justice’s departure.</p>

<p>But on Saturday, the outlook became grim for the GOP. Assuming Obama appoints a successor in the next year (the line in blue), the Court is solidly left-tilted. With the three youngest justices on the liberal side (Kagan, 55; Sotomayor, 61; and likely the new appointee), the odds favor Democrats to such an extent that even thirty years from now there is a 61% chance of a liberal majority.</p>

<p>Republicans in <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/mitch-mcconnell-antonin-scalia-supreme-court-nomination-219248">Congress</a>—and on the <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/2/13/10987814/obama-republicans-scalia">campaign trail</a>, and in <a href=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/columnists/kass/ct-supreme-court-scalia-kass-0217-20160216-column.html">the press</a>—are not willing to succumb to this scary, leftist future without a fight. If they succeed in blocking all of Obama’s nominations until he leaves office next January, they can’t quite ensure a conservative majority (that will be decided at the ballot box) but they can still improve their situation considerably. In this case (the line in red), by around 2030 it will be as though Scalia hadn’t died this week. If obstruction fails, that won’t happen until around 2060—when all current justices, alas, will likely be deceased.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that there’s a lengthy uptick from about 2035 to 2055 in all three cases. This is because the current conservative justices are, for the most part, old men. They’re likely to pass away sooner than their liberal peers.</p><br>
 

<p class="b1">So what?</p>

<img src="http://milobeckman.github.io/content/2016/2/scalia-2.png">

<p>What does all this mean for the future of the judiciary? Many of the Court’s landmark rulings are decided by 5-4 ideological majorities. Every additional year with a liberal majority will inevitably result in a handful of important rulings supported by the American left. By running 100,000 simulations of the next 45 years (after 2060, all cases are about the same) I determined that Scalia’s death last Saturday created, on average, 6.3 years of liberal 5-4 rulings.</p>

<p>This is huge. The power of the Supreme Court is such that these 6.3 years really do matter. For the future of the American legal system, Scalia’s death is the largest piece of news in quite some time. By comparison, news that a Democrat was sure to win the White House this November would only add 3.9 years of liberal 5-4 rulings (5.1 if Scalia had not died).</p>

<p>This also contextualizes the fight over Scalia’s successor. If the GOP manages to pull off a delay until 2017, Scalia’s death will have only created 1.4 additional years of liberal 5-4 rulings—still a huge event, but reducing the damage by nearly 80%.</p><br>
 

<p class="b1">The case for RBG to step down</p>

<p>With the program already written, I decided to look into another question of Supreme Court tenure: Should Ruth Bader Ginsburg—the oldest liberal on the Court—retire from her post under Obama if a Republican is elected to take office in 2017?</p>

<img src="http://milobeckman.github.io/content/2016/2/scalia-3.png">

<p>The answer, to an ideological liberal like Ginsburg, is clearly yes—but perhaps to an even greater extent than most recognize. In 2025, for instance, the chance of a conservative majority will be reduced by Ginsburg’s retirement from 32% to 23%. Using the same metric as above, this will create a further 2.8 years of liberal 5-4 decisions.</p>

<img src="http://milobeckman.github.io/content/2016/2/scalia-4.png">

<p>This, of course, assumes that Obama would be able to push through any appointment under a hostile Republican Congress. But if he can, Ginsburg can advance her agenda more by retiring under a Democrat than she could by, say, swaying Clarence Thomas to her side in every case for the next 34 months.</p><br>
 

<p class="b1">How bias in appointments affects all this</p>

<p>One final topic I looked into was the effect of gender bias on the Court’s ideological split. Female justices are empirically more likely to be liberal, and also likely to live longer. I ran more simulations, this time replacing my earlier 50-50 assumption with my best guess at gender breakdown per party: judicial appointments of the last two presidents. Obama <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/obama-brief">appointed</a> 42% female judges; Bush only 22%.</p>

<img src="http://milobeckman.github.io/content/2016/2/scalia-5.png">

<p>The effect is very minimal—I’ve zoomed in substantially here to make it more evident. (The little ups and downs are just noise from the random simulations; ignore them.) Starting around 2045, when future appointees begin to age out, this gender bias creates a slight perpetual advantage for liberals: about 51% instead of 50%. Over time, this adds up. Of course, Republicans are likely to come around and start appointing women before too long.</p>

<p>Democrats are also historically more likely to appoint minority judges—36% under Obama compared with 18% under Bush—who, statistically, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/huge-racial-gap-in-life-expectancy-2014-1">pass away at younger ages</a>. My data source did not include information on race. In any case, this is highly confounded with income and education; it may be that minorities under consideration for a nomination have just as long a life expectancy as their white peers.</p>

<p>Overall, though, our system creates wacky incentives for the president and Congress, where race, gender, and a year or two in age can have potentially drastic outcomes on law in the United States.</p>

<p>Which is to say, having no term limits might not be the most sensible idea.</p>
