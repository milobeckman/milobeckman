<p>Imagine you write news that is published online. Yesterday, your intel found that 60% of all social media clicks went to articles about Hamilton, 30% to articles about Trump University, 10% to the nomination of Jeff Sessions. You believe Attorney-General Sessions is the most consequential piece of news. You now face a dilemma: What do you report on?</p>

<p>The answer: It doesn't matter. Whatever you choose, 60% of clicks will go to Hamilton, 30% to Trump University, 10% to Sessions.</p>

<p>The problem is not a supply of fake news, it's a demand for fake news. If not the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo">100 Macedonian websites</a>, someone else would have called Clinton a criminal. The clicks were there. Someone just needed to provide the article.</p>

<p>In other words, the market for information is freer than ever before, and its revealed preference is that we don't put much of a premium on truth.</p>

<p>If we agree this is problematic, we must either change norms or regulate the market for information. It would be an immense feat to ask 1.8 billion Facebook users to have intentionality about their every click. It seems reasonable to ask Facebook to play the role of regulator here.</p>

<p>This means hiring not just journalists and editors, but sociologists, economists, political scientists. It means writing algorithms whose bottom line is the public interest. It means losing clicks. It will not be in Facebook's self-interest to do this unless we as users pressure them to do so â€” perhaps by boycotting if they do not.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley has faith in the free market. Whether a private company can step up to the plate and stem the tide of misinformation/distraction will be an excellent test of this faith.</p>
