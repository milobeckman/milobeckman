<p>milobeckman.com is (as of June 2017) an attempt to collect all of my various projects into one place. The home page is a somewhat chronological summary of my academic career so far. This site also has some blog posts, but I realized I don't like blogging, so it's not a blog anymore.</p>

<p>Feel free to email me or send me something interesting, at milobeckman [at] gmail [dot] com!</p>

<p>I programmed this site and its content management system from scratch (mostly in Python) and hosted it on GitHub Pages. The full source code is available <a href="https://github.com/milobeckman/milobeckman.github.io/tree/master/workspace">here</a>, the bulk of it in milobeckman.py. I intend to keep adding to it as I learn more HTML/Javascript.</p>
