<p>milobeckman.com is (as of June 2018) an attempt to collect all of my various projects into one place. The home page is an attempt to give an overview of my work though since I limited to three links per area there are plenty things missing. Some more things are available in blog-style chronological posts, but I realized I don't like blogging so that's fairly incomplete too. Honestly this is a work in progress and some pages like <a href="http://milobeckman.com/years/2017.html">this one</a> aren't actually linked to/accessible from any obvious place. I'm trying to update/improve the site when I have a break between other projects and as I learn more HTML and Javascript.</p>

<p>I programmed this site and its content management system from scratch, mostly in Python. In retrospect I'm not sure why I did this since there are plenty very good website-building tools out there which make much prettier and more functional websites. As is this site doesn't really work on mobile and I'm not sure what it looks like on anything other than Chrome+MacBook. And sometimes it gives security errors. But it's very customizable and I have full control over it, and I think it looks/feels pretty good. And I learned a lot of HTML and CSS in the process. So here we are.</p>

<p>The full source code is available <a href="https://github.com/milobeckman/milobeckman.github.io/tree/master/workspace">here</a>, the bulk of it in milobeckman.py.</p>
