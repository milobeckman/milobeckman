<p>In high school I was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/flabbergasted1/?sort=top">top user</a> on <a href="http://www.reddit.com">reddit</a>, a content aggregator and the 8th most popular website in the United States. I was one of the first 30 users to reach 100,000 comment karma, moderated top subreddits such as <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive">r/explainlikeimfive</a> (10m subscribers) and <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu">r/fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu</a> (500k subscribers), and created content that is still frequently rehosted and shared across social media without attribution.</p>

<p>Most of this content was pretty stupid, so this is all I really have to show for it:</p>
