<br>
<p class="b2">1.</p><p><b>This election season is not quite​</b> like anything we’ve seen; beyond this, pundits agree on rather little. That politicians, donors, journalists, strategists, and academics all misread the American electorate last summer is now obvious. What exactly we got wrong, though, is not.</p><p>Here’s what we know: A plurality of voters in the party of Lincoln desire as their president a brash, xenophobic narcissist with the temperament and political experience of a middle schooler. This bloc defies simple categorization but is most densely concentrated in areas with low educational attainment among whites, high rates of evangelical Christianity, and significant presence of racial minorities (who, to a first approximation, do not participate in Republican primaries). The movement’s core voters are joined by a sizable chunk of nearly every demographic group in the GOP, as well as a number of Independents and Democrats, in supporting a candidate who has elicited comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Wallace, and Benito Mussolini.</p><p>Here’s what we don’t know: Why is this happening? It is difficult to ascertain exactly what this grassroots movement wants; to the extent that they demand specific policies, they tend to range from incoherent to unconscionable. More often, these Americans seem driven by what they see as a compelling brand: Exclusionary white Christian nationalism, humiliating comeuppance for cosmopolitan elites, the end of political correctness, and myopically unilateral big stick diplomacy. Somewhere in there, too, is the personal appeal of a tremendously wealthy man who appears to succeed without even trying, a man who was not anointed by the ruling political class and who plays by his own rules whether you like it or not.</p>


<p>In the rising heat of the election, the discourse on this new breed of right-­wing populism has languished at the level of sound bites, news cycles, politicians and polls. Most coverage focuses on the man rather than the movement, the election rather than the era. We are too quick to attribute the will of many millions to the agency of an individual. In so doing, we are ignoring the biggest political story in a generation.</p><p>The circus that has unfolded over the last year is not so much a dramatic new chapter in American history as it is a revelation of an undercurrent in our political life that has not yet come under public scrutiny. These voters have been here, this sentiment has been here—we should not believe that anything changed last June or expect that anything will change this November. We have not, as a nation, suddenly fallen ill; we’ve just received a new diagnosis which collates and clarifies our many symptoms.</p><p>
As such, it would benefit us to take a step back, away from this candidate and even this century. We should view the current election as a mere snapshot of a complex, dynamic organism. What does the new data tells us about the shifting contours of American life?</p><p><b>Academics in a variety of disciplines</b> ​distinguish between the “proximate cause” and “ultimate cause” of an event or characteristic. Why did I eat breakfast this morning? Proximate cause: I was hungry. Ultimate cause: Sufficient nutrition is essential to survival, so natural selection favors those with a hunger response that compels eating at regular intervals. The proximate cause is useful for analyzing my personal decision process, but it loses its explanatory power at the population level. To understand why an entire group of people eats breakfast, it is insufficient to say “they were all hungry.” Rather, we require an ultimate cause—an explanation as to why so many individuals with different lives and habits all became hungry around the same time.</p><p>Analogously, there is a limit to the usefulness of analyzing voter behavior through individual testimony. A citizen may vote in response to personal desires or experience—say, the loss of a job—but political movements form only in response to larger­-scale phenomena—say, a sputtering economy. As informative as it is to hear a primary voter named Eileen credit her support of the Republican frontrunner to his “enthusiasm and realizing this country needs such a change,” this does not tell us what has led so many men and women like Eileen to hold similar sentiments. We must uncover the broad political and economic trends that trickle into voters’ lives and inform their decisions.</p><p>This is why responsible election coverage requires speaking about voters on the level of demographic and not just ideological groups. While it may be uncomfortable to speak of “the black vote,” black and white Americans—again, taken as a whole—have vastly different lived experiences which inform their political decision­-making. When exit polls reveal that a strong majority of young, white liberals support Bernie Sanders, this does not imply that these voters support Sanders simply because they are young and white. These voters do genuinely and rationally believe that democratic socialism is the best course for America, and this belief is coherently derived from their lived experiences: a financial crisis, a weak job market, student debt, and so forth.</p><p>The Republican field this year is more resistant to such analysis. To be sure, commentators have identified numerous correlates for each candidate’s support, as well as peculiarities of this year that could allow for a third­-party-­style insurgents. These piecemeal attempts, though, fail to tell a cohesive story. It is far too improbable that such an array of independent factors should coincide on a single man in a single year. A “stars align” approach also does not explain related trends that have been bubbling under the surface for several elections, or parallel elections across the Western world.</p><p>What is the linchpin? What exactly are these voters rallying around or against?</p><p class="b2">2.</p><p><b>If humans are resistant to change,</b> ​institutions are positively hostile to it. Large, multilateral organizations with formal rules of engagement require a substantial amount of coordination to enact even the least controversial changes. Our workweek has five days and forty hours not because economists recommend this schedule, but because the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 mandated it and no subsequent law has repealed it. (The seven day week itself is an indirect product of ancient Babylonian astrology; its persistence speaks to long reach of history.)</p><p>This lean towards stasis is exacerbated by a hardy form of selection bias in the chain of command. As new members filter into an institution, they are trained and incentivized to obey existing standards and practices, reducing their change­-making potential. Think of the college freshman who adjusts his persona as he pledges a fraternity, or the CEO candidate beloved by the board for having no major critiques of business practices. The power hierarchy within an institution rewards adherents to the status quo by promoting them to positions where they will be better equipped to maintain it.</p><p>As such, the world we inhabit is best understood not as an intentional work of engineering but as a gradual accumulation of values and technologies, with past and present layered like sediments in a stratigraphic column. A voter searches for the nearest polling booth on her smartphone, drives down roads paved for horses, past buildings forming a pastiche of architectural eras, to a historically black school that was never desegregated, where she casts her ballot by punchcard. And this is to say nothing of the candidates between whom she chooses.</p><p>Consider that, as late as 1942, the U.S. Armed Forces maintained a horseback cavalry. Decades after the first successful deployments of tanks in World War I, Chief of Cavalry John Knowles Herr insisted that horses were still superior: they were better suited for varying terrain and less prone to malfunction; they were in large part responsible for the Allied victory in World War I; the new machines had not yet passed “the acid test of war”; in all the traditional missions of cavalry, airplanes and motor vehicles could, at best, assist the men on horses.</p><p>How are we to understand Herr, this agent of stasis? Based on his writings and his colleagues’ descriptions, he was not a stick­-in-­the-­mud so much as a zealot, an earnest champion for what he saw as the near­-sacred bond between horse and man. This passion helped him rise to the powerful position of Chief of Cavalry; it also blinded him to any advancements which suggested that change was necessary. Long after his dismissal, in an age of nuclear arsenals and guerrilla warfare, Herr still believed that conspiracy and jealousy had caused his downfall:</p><p class="quote">That there was influence brought to bear by certain industries which would profit heavily by the production of the enormously expensive tank and other mechanized vehicles is almost certain. Then, there was the ever-­eternal green­-eyed monster of jealousy which had been aroused in the breasts of the other services, especially among soft and inactive officers behind desks, over the color and glamour attached to the cavalry, over the good times which the officers of that branch enjoyed in their sports at all the cavalry posts, and over the certain indefinable social prestige which the man on horse, the cavalier, the hidalgo, the gentleman, has always had over the man on foot. All these influences combined, and, amidst the excitement at the outbreak of war, managed to eliminate what they called an archaic branch.</p><p>This is institutional inertia: Powerful figures anointed under the old regime position themselves in opposition to the tides of change, not out of malice or self­-interest but a genuine fondness for the existing arrangement. They protect the status quo not merely because they excel in it, as some cynics propose; rather, they both excel in it and seek to protect it because they consider it good. Those advantaged under a set of institutions see themselves not as beneficiaries of privilege but as the loyal heirs to a righteous system.</p><p>The 26th Cavalry Regiment faced a fully modern unit of Japanese tanks and machine gun­-wielding infantrymen. Despite a resistance recalled by those present with the glamor­-tinted nostalgia of an esteemed tradition in its twilight years, the horsemen eventually ceded the Bataan Peninsula to Imperial Japan. The highly competitive military was forced to correct its mistake, but our domestic government still employs horseback officers.</p><p><b>A government is more complicated than</b> ​a branch of the military, of course, but the two institutions deal with similar matters of prioritization. Just as a branch chief must apportion funding and manpower, politicians must allocate their time and resources to whichever projects they deem most important. Informed political debates usually boil down to disagreements over the relative priority of various goals, ideals, or groups: rights of women and rights of the unborn, economic growth and economic equality, undocumented immigrants, police officers, Christians, working families, job creators, Palestinians, and so forth. At a glance, one’s political views reflect one’s personal priorities.</p><p>Interest groups, under this conception, are organizations of people with similar priority hierarchies—or, at least, similar disagreements with the existing priority hierarchy. Trade unions seek to raise the priority of laborers; the National Rifle Association seeks to raise the priority of gun­-owners. For the NAACP and Black Lives Matter, the status claim is implied in the name: that black Americans have been de-prioritized relative to their white counterparts, and that politicians should seek to rectify this inequity.</p><p>Understandably, many voters are most motivated by their greatest personally felt injustice. Whites are less likely than blacks to be involved with Black Lives Matter—even if they do believe that black lives matter—simply because they themselves do not bear the brunt of racial inequality. On the flip side, some blacks are single-­issue voters for racial justice; some women are single­-issue voters for reproductive rights and equal pay; some working­-class whites near the Mexican border are single­-issue voters for tougher immigration laws. Climate change, which occurs gradually and to no one in particular, is not yet the greatest personally felt injustice of any American, and thus we are unlikely to see progress on this front until it is.</p><p>Politicians, whether or not they care to admit it, seem to be broadly aware of these demographic patterns of prioritization. Consider Mitt Romney’s infamous remarks to a roomful of donors: “Forty­-seven percent of Americans pay no income tax. So our message of low taxes doesn't connect.” His core constituency was those Americans, predominantly white and well-­off, whose greatest personally felt injustice is high taxes. His promise as a candidate was to prioritize their plight. (Economists will note there are other reasons to lower taxes, but Romney did not seem to have these in mind when speaking of his “message of low taxes.”)</p><p>All these individuals, interest groups, politicians and parties sum to the institutional whole of our polity. In the national tug-­of­-war over values, each player throws its weight behind whichever ragtag coalition generally supports similar shifts in priority.</p><p>But the weighty, idle grasp of institutional inertia is not neutral in this contest. Our current political institutions carry an implicit prioritization hierarchy, and—like the fraternity pledge and the CEO candidate—each new generation of leaders is bred to support it. Change, even popular change, occurs slowly, countervailed by the disproportionate power of those who oppose it. This is the mechanism by which the past seeps into the present.</p><p class="b2">3.</p><p><b>A familiar quote, often misattributed to​</b> Sinclair Lewis, states that “when fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.” This is a misrepresentation both of Lewis’s own views and, I believe, the nature of American Christianity. What Lewis actually said, in a 1938 novel about a fascist who rides a populist campaign to the White House, is that “in America ... the worst Fascists were they who disowned the word ‘Fascism’ and preached enslavement to Capitalism under the style of Constitutional and Traditional Native American Liberty.” Eight years later, in a novel about an unscrupulous man who seeks wealth and prestige by any means necessary, Lewis adds, “I just wish people wouldn’t quote Lincoln or the Bible, or hang out the flag or the cross, to cover up something that belongs more to the bank-­book and the three golden balls.” In other words, we might say: When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying T​he Art of the Deal.​</p><p>American Christians are not unified by religious doctrine so much as by a particular set of social attitudes. Religious creeds differ markedly from church to church, but nearly all white Christian denominations are united in their belief that American capitalism does a generally good job of rewarding merit. When the Public Religion Research Institute asked Americans a series of questions about the relative importance of personal decisions and institutional factors in determining economic outcomes, white mainline Protestants, white evangelical Protestants, and white Catholics were more likely than any other groups to believe that an individual’s choices were the greatest factor in her economic well­-being.</p><p>Ironically, this attitude is best explained through institutional factors. Churches, by their very nature, inculcate their members with certain values and beliefs; the community and identity aspects of American Christianity also propagate these values and beliefs by diffusion between members of the same social network. Given the vastly different social attitudes of black Protestants—who hold far more liberal economic beliefs than any other religious category—we cannot attribute the pro-­market bent of white Christianity to the Bible or the teachings of Jesus. Rather, we have to conclude that these beliefs are passed down through the institutions themselves.</p><p>If you are unconvinced, consider this telling result from an Oxford study on American religion: Black members of integrated congregations hold social attitudes closer to white members of integrated congregations than to black members of black congregations. That is to say, black churchgoers adopt the social attitudes of their white peers and pastors when integrating into historically white churches. This is a crucial point in understand race in modern America: White churches, white schools, and white neighborhoods have been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/">cautiously</a>​ integrated; their black counterparts, by and large, have not. As a result, integrated churches today hold similar economic attitudes to their all­-white forebears. The members of these institutions change, but the values do not.</p><p>Where did these institutional values originate? While the religious left often highlights the seemingly socialist nature of Jesus’s teachings (“go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor,” for one example), this misremembers the foundations of our nation’s religious doctrines. Early European settlers of North America were deeply committed to a Protestant work ethic; the various sects tended to agree that the chosen would be revealed through their greater prosperity. Historian Keith Thomas reports that in the 1650s “a female sectary ... fell into a <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=x8G29btA1lsC&pg=PT514&lpg=PT514&dq=keith+thomas+a+female+sectary">religious depression</a> ​when she saw her neighbors enjoying greater prosperity than she did, for it could only mean they prayed at home with greater assiduity.”</p><p>As a broad oversimplification, then, the institutions of white American Christianity hold that the virtuous and diligent will be rewarded on Earth by the grace of God. Developed by forefathers who struggled with religious oppression in Europe and found good fortune in the New World, these institutions also believe that this form of Christian meritocracy is specific to our land: a full 62% of Americans of any faith believe that “God has granted America a <a href="http://publicreligion.org/research/2015/06/survey-americans-believe-protests-make-country-better-support-decreases-dramatically-protesters-identified-black/">special role</a> ​in human history.” For these reasons and others, white Christians tend to support economic reforms less and believe in equality of opportunity more than Americans writ large.</p><p><b>Movement conservatives, typified by Paul Ryan,</b> ​Mitt Romney, and the editorial board of the National Review,​f​ind strange bedfellows​i​n these Christian conservatives. While both groups generally support laissez­-faire capitalism, their reasons are vastly different. For movement conservatives, social policies like entitlement spending, progressive taxation, and regulation of businesses are harmful to the long-­run health of the economy, shifting control from the efficient private sector to the bureaucratic public sector and causing unfavorable shifts in incentives along the way. Inefficiency and slow growth are their bugbears; leaving the machinery of capitalism unrestrained is the surest path to prosperity for all.</p><p>As such, any barriers to entry are anathema to these fiscal conservatives. Conservative economists broadly support <a href="http://www.cato.org/blog/super-majority-economists-agree-trade-barriers-should-go">free trade</a> ​and <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323346304578427001422733598">immigration reform</a>​—policies which reduce artificial constraints on labor, lowering prices and enhancing equality of opportunity. The most efficient economy would fill each job with the man or woman best suited to the role; limiting the labor pool to the economically arbitrary category of American citizens can only be harmful. This was the philosophy, for strategic as much as ideological reasons, outlined in the GOP’s 2012 autopsy report.</p><p>The very notion of a privileged group, then, runs counter to the goals of fiscal conservatives. Adam Smith himself remarked that slavery was, from an economic perspective, <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23722188?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">inefficient</a> because free association of labor would permit better job-­matching. Movement conservatives’ endorsement of laissez­-faire policies is contingent upon the assumption that free people will gradually cease discrimination for their own long­-run benefit—or, alternatively, that discrimination has already ceased for this reason.</p><p>Republican elites have, for some time now, assumed that all their constituents share in this general ideological bent. Ever since the electoral romps of the 1980s, the GOP has hewed to the notion that a winning coalition can only be built with a movement conservative at the helm. If Christian values and social policies bring more voters under the tent—as with George W. Bush’s compassionate conservatism—all the better, so long as there is general consensus on the basic principles of small government, low taxes, non­-intervention, free association.</p><p>We now know this to not be the case. Majorities of Republican voters support a ban on gay marriage (63%), a temporary bar on Muslims entering the country (67%), construction of a wall on the Mexican border (70%), reversal of free trade agreements (53%), making abortion illegal in all or most cases (59%), and a host of other decidedly interventionist policies. Perhaps it is finally time to acknowledge that the Reagan coalition was not built on a shared ideological foundation so much as a shared cultural identity: the red­-white­-and­-blue America of anti­-Communism, Christian family values, law and order, global hegemony, and the infallible leadership of the smooth­-talking, horseback­-riding Real American Man.</p><p>Amidst a cold war, a drug epidemic, a hostage crisis, an economic nosedive, and an oil embargo, Ronald Reagan promised safety, security, a return to normalcy. He was an ideological conservative, to be sure, but he was praised foremost as a great communicator—that is, an appealing brand. His campaign ad “Prouder, Stronger, Better” is one of the most famous in American electoral history, showing white Americans working, buying homes, getting married, smiling and hugging. The theme of his 1980 convention, plastered across posters and pins, was “Make America Great Again.”</p><p class="b2">4.</p><p><b>1867: The war is lost, but</b> the S​outh will not accede to the demands of Northern abolitionists without resistance. As the Republican project of Reconstruction brings carpetbaggers down to enforce the new political rights of freedmen, angry Southern whites gather in large numbers to preserve the social order of their fathers and their fathers’ fathers. These “Redeemers” have lost the country of their youth. Occupied by the radical Northern military, impoverished by the loss of free labor, even subjected to the atrocity of educated blacks in positions of political power, the losers of the new order form paramilitary and terrorist groups in a concerted effort at preservationism. The Ku Klux Klan is founded, its stated goal being "the re-enfranchisement and emancipation of the white men of the South, and the restitution of the Southern people to all their rights."</p><p>1877: Reconstruction comes to a premature end. In a historically consequential backroom deal, Republicans cede the South in exchange for the Presidency. The troops head North. The tug­-of-­war ends. Democrats retake state legislatures and proceed to rapidly disenfranchise blacks through poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. The number of black Southern officeholders dwindles from about 15% to 0%. (As of 2016, the proportion of non­-white state legislators nationwide has only crawled back up to 14%.) Barred from educational and economic opportunities, free blacks return to cotton fields to labor for room and board under wealthy white planters. In the absence of justice-­minded activists, the arc of history bends towards history.</p><p>It is seductive to imagine our nation’s racial history as a steady march towards progress, averting one’s eyes from the painful backsteps and focusing on the net gains. And indeed, we have come a long way from chattel slavery. But this armchair observation would grant little solace to the freed men and women of the Reconstruction Era who watched their precious few rights evaporate in the name of traditionalism. It would grant little solace to the industrious, resilient migrants of the Great Migration who uprooted their families and left the only homes they’d ever known, only to be excluded from the American Dream by pen, gavel, and bomb. It would grant little solace to the blacks of the Reagan Era who suffered silently as their fathers, brothers, and sons were incriminated and returned to captivity for expressing the symptoms of every ghettoized out-­group in modern history. And it would grant little solace to the youth of today’s black underclass who continue to languish under a regime of de facto apartheid; miseducated in all­-black schools funded by meager local property taxes; denied jobs, loans, and scholarships on the basis of their grades or manner of speech; pushed into menial or even criminal work to fund the bare necessities of life; villainized by the white lawmakers, police, and juries so conspicuously out of place in their segregated world.</p><p>
The educated middle and upper classes will never meet these Americans or hear direct testimony of their plight. We will meet the children and grandchildren of escapees, who have amassed in two generations the wealth and status that many whites have had centuries to accrue. Their presence in historically white social spheres gives “mainstream” America the cosmetic appearance of an integrated society, allowing well­-meaning whites to ignore the toxic institutions underfoot. Ben Carson announces than anyone can escape poverty with a little resolve and an undying faith in God (and, of course, a few groundbreaking accomplishments in neurosurgery). The white audience applauds. The cameras cut to a Hispanic woman.</p><p>Even as immigration has expanded the racial makeup of America beyond Anglo­ and Afro­, the institutions of racial hierarchy have remained largely intact. According to an <a href="https://www.nap.edu/catalog/21746/the-integration-of-immigrants-into-american-society">expansive report</a> ​by the National Academies Press, immigrants “do achieve labor market integration” within a generation, but only into the “racialized space” associated with their national origin or religion. Immigrants from South and Central America, Africa, and Muslim parts of Asia are ghettoized and assimilate into <a href="http://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/">neighborhoods occupied by the existing racial underclass</a>,​while immigrants from Europe and <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-two-asian-americas">now some Asians</a> ​are admitted into the non-­Hispanic white “mainstream.” Until recently, the banner of whiteness did not cover Catholics, Eastern and Southern Europeans, or Jews; as these groups became white, they broke out of crime­-filled ghettos like Little Italy and—after a <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp7725.pdf">name change</a>​—joined the ranks of the ruling class.</p><p>So yes, we’ve made progress. But we have a long, tortuous road ahead of us. To presume an intrinsic forward impetus is to wash one’s hands of any responsibility to take part in the toil of progress.</p><p><b>Naturally, some do not see themselves</b> ​as benefitting from progress. The self-­assessed losers of the perceived new order fear that an influx of immigrants, refugees, and blacks into the mainstream will lower their score in some zero-­sum game. The reminders of educated elites—that the economy doesn't work that way, that inclusivity is in everyone’s long-­term interest, that these same fears caused the lynchings and race riots of the 20th century—fall on deaf ears. This “loser class” doesn't want lectures, they want validation. “They're taking our jobs.” “We don't win anymore.”</p><p>Though the educated elites are wary to admit it, not all these fears are unfounded. In a successfully integrated America, the loser class will need to compete for those positions historically reserved for white men. Some whites, especially those without the wealth or education to provide a safety net, will find themselves worse off than their fathers, like many white Southerners under Reconstruction. And indeed, the life expectancy of middle­-aged whites has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/health/death-rates-rising-for-middle-aged-white-americans-study-finds.html?_r=1">stumbled for the first time</a> ​as painkillers and suicides​in rural areas take more lives. None dare say it aloud, but the haunting truth is that we are finally beginning to integrate America’s underclass.</p><p>Of course, these white losers are still better off than their non-­white counterparts in nearly every measure. An American born white can expect to enjoy <a href="http://kff.org/other/state-indicator/life-expectancy-by-re/">four more years of life</a> ​than if she’d been born black. White families have an <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/12/12/racial-wealth-gaps-great-recession/">​average wealth</a> of $142,000 while black families subsist with a shocking $11,000. Still, white Americans on average believe that there is today m​ore <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/08/white-people-think-racial-discrimination-in-america-is-basically-over/">anti­-white bias</a> than anti­-black bias. <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/Publications/prospect_theory.pdf">Behavioral research</a>​ confirms the common­-sense notion that humans judge their situation relative to an earlier set point, not some universal objective scale. Similarly, the diminution of white political power relative to historical norms, while real, is hardly tragic: Whites now have one, rather than two, major parties unquestionably reflecting their political will. Bear in mind that, by virtue of <a href="http://www.nuf.org/sites/default/files/Documents/NUF_diversitycounts_V2FINAL.pdf">electoral majorities</a> ​in 46 out of 50 state legislatures, whites still have the political power necessary to repeal the 13th amendment and reinstate slavery, should they so desire.</p><p>So should we have sympathy for the predicament of this loser class? Of course. Should we prioritize their fears over the real, daily plight of the existing racial underclasses? To do so in good faith requires an explicit ideology of white supremacy.</p><p class="b2">5.</p><p>Woodrow Wilson, the first Southern man e​lected President after the Civil War, represented for many voters an opportunity to reject the cultural changes of the preceding six decades. Without any assistance from Congress, Wilson re-segregated federal agencies and offices, dismissed 15 of the 17 black men then holding federal positions, and set in place the practice of requiring photographs for federal job applicants. His racial philosophy, common for Southerners of his era, held that slaves had been servilely devoted to their masters until white Northerners</p><p>fooled them into hating their caretakers. Symbolically, he screened T​he Birth of a Nation​at the White House, a glowing tribute to the KKK which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5sYrwXRlDY">portrayed</a>​ Reconstruction-­era black officeholders as barefoot degenerates, drinking liquor and eating fried chicken on the floor of the South Carolina legislature.</p><p>Today, Birth of a Nation ​is considered one of the greatest and most influential films in cinematic history. It set numerous technical precedents that define modern filmmaking: an original score, tracking shots, subtitles, flashbacks, and natural acting, to name a few. It perfected the narrative structure of visual storytelling—rising action towards a climactic finish—which persists to this day. By far the most successful film of its era, it popularized what is perhaps the most enduring archetype of American cinema: the righteous, renegade, white man who takes on a corrupt or misguided establishment. A century later, Hollywood blockbusters are still defined by these James Bonds, Ferris Buellers, John McClanes, Bruce Waynes, Luke Skywalkers, and Harry Potters. As of 2015, men account for 91% of film directors and 88% of protagonists; as of 2013, whites account for 82% of film directors and 83% of protagonists.</p><p>By a similar token, Woodrow Wilson is still perceived as one of America’s best presidents. He ranked 6th in a 2011 survey of scholars, down only two places from a 1948 survey despite the dramatic shifts in social mores between these dates. It’s small wonder, then, that Princeton’s</p><p>
board of trustees voted in April to leave the name of its Woodrow Wilson School unchanged in spite of much­-publicized protests by students of color. In the same month, Yale dismissed similar requests to change the name of Calhoun College, appeasing protesters with the announcement that two new colleges would be named after Pauli Murray, a black woman, and Benjamin Franklin, a white man. Given that all Yale colleges are presently named after white men, this superficially even­-handed decision—like the decision to keep Andrew Jackson on the back of the $20—seems to be saying, “We want to move away from our history of white supremacy and patriarchy, but not too quickly.”</p><p>Recent history has indeed seen a decline in the fraction of the world’s economic, political, and cultural capital that is held by straight, European-­descended men, but at a pace so sluggish and beset with reversals that it may take centuries to erase the legacy of past crimes. David Cole</p><p>notes in T​he New York Review of Books ​that the percentage of Yale’s faculty who are black has crawled from 0% in 1701 to 3% in 2016, an elegant demonstration of institutional inertia. (The true proportion is closer to 2.3%, and has actually declined in the last 25 years.) At the same time, he condemns the student protesters for their radical demands and methods, which he sees as a threat to free speech. This strain of passive equivocation, all too common among white authority figures, will ensure that only 4% of Yale’s faculty are black by 2121.</p><p>That said, the pace of cultural​change does appear to be temporarily accelerated relative to historical norms. In just over a year, we’ve seen the federal legalization of same-­sex marriage, the Democrats’ adoption of parts of the Black Lives Matter platform, the removal of the Confederate Flag from the South Carolina statehouse, the decision to put an escaped slave on currency, undergraduate protests in the name of social justice, the first three late night hosts ever to not be white men, the rapid gains of the transgender acceptance movement, a Super Bowl halftime show featuring Black Panther imagery, numerous resignations over racist or otherwise unsavory comments, all under the gaze of our first President ever to not be a white man. It’s no surprise, then, that many Americans feel victimized by these changes handed down to them by cosmopolitan elites. As Justice Antonin Scalia bitterly dissented, “no social transformation without representation.”</p><p>In particular, these voters lament that the nation has become “politically correct,” a masterful rhetorical catchall which casts this assortment of cultural shifts in a negative, vaguely Stalinist light without explicitly asserting that any individual change is bad. They’re not so much disagreeing as playing the devil’s advocate, that eternal friend of the status quo. If given the wheel, they would not know where to steer; instead, they slam the brakes by questioning and re­questioning every proposed change.</p><p>This aimless form of rejectionism is all but indefensible on a political stage, and so Americans</p><p>must turn towards the gleefully amoral world of entertainment for an outlet. South Park, long a popular voice for countercultural satire, has just dedicated a ten­-episode season to the struggles of its four white, male protagonists against a new “PC Principal” who takes absurd and often violent measures against children to enforce minutiae of the progressive agenda like preferred gender pronouns. The show’s creators, who have inspired the increasingly relevant term “<a href="http://www.city-journal.org/html/we%E2%80%99re-not-losing-culture-wars-anymore-12482.html">South Park Republican</a>,​” stop short of an endorsement, instead taking potshots at both sides and towing the line between advocacy and self­-satire. And yet, the audience is left feeling that the only satisfying resolution would be for a white knight to appear uninvited and tell PC Principal, “You’re fired.” Love it or hate it, this is a real and influential sector of our culture.</p><p>Ideologically unhinged as it may be, this reactionary attitude is entirely understandable. Many Americans are impotently watching as elites attempt to update our language and symbols to reflect our updated values, and they feel that their way of life is being threatened. One needn’t be a straight, white man to feel this way, of course—anyone raised within American institutions, anyone fed the messages of our films and history books, anyone who identifies proudly with the past and present image of American culture, ignoring its warts, will feel a great loss.</p><p>But to be “politically incorrect” is not to righteously resist the whims of a corrupt or misguided establishment. It is to passively accept the dominant language of white supremacy and patriarchy, to make oneself idly complicit in the preservation of an unjust order.</p><p>In 1916, after T​he Birth of a Nation​had precipitated nationwide race riots against blacks and contributed to the founding of the second KKK, D.W. Griffith followed up his masterwork with the three­-and-­a-­half hour epic, I​ntolerance.​Far from an apology for inciting racial violence, Intolerance​suggested that groups such as the NAACP had been intolerant in condemning T​he Birth of a Nation,​comparing their attacks on a man speaking his truth to the crucifixion of Jesus. Had the term existed at the time, Griffith might have lamented that the South doesn’t have time for political correctness.</p><p class="b2">6.</p><p><b>We find ourselves in 2016, witnessing​</b> a backslide in excruciating slow motion. We gawk and gasp, as if we've never seen this before, as if we haven't learned a thousand times over that progress is a random walk, that tragedy is not a blip but a trend, that a forward lurch does not erase the reactionaries so much as tighten their grip on the back end of the rope. Amidst the guilty spectacle of it all, some are fortunate enough to laugh. Others wearily prepare to refight the battles of their grandmothers.</p><p>How did we get here? At a glance: Around 1700, the technologically empowered states of Europe began a full­-throttle project of global conquest. Around 1945, when Europe was forced to discard its enabling principle of moral superiority, the imperial powers ceased the overt acquisition of new territories, confiscation of natural resources, and subjugation of non­-European peoples. The institutions remained: Stolen treasures populate the British Museum, the English language dominates the world, straight lines drawn in Berlin divide Africa, European men legislate across North America. Then as now, the world’s wealthiest nations are</p><p>
those who were on the receiving end of a centuries­-long plunder. Then as now, the world’s poorest peoples are those who were on the bottom rung of a centuries­-long racial hierarchy. Europe took over the world and retired.</p><p>By now, some seventy years into the Great Hangover, a familiar pattern has emerged: Brief spells of progress followed by brief spells of pushback punctuate long stretches of stasis. The fire this time? A perceived cultural upheaval, marked by the increasing prominence and influence of people who are not white men, has left a sizable contingent of Americans feeling existentially threatened. Those who may actually stand to lose out are joined by many more who have been influenced by the institutions founded and largely still maintained by white men. Together, they hope to resist the new America and re­-aggrandize the old America, an America of white supremacy, misogyny, and imperialism. Sadly, this lengthy slogan doesn’t fit on hats.</p><p>This is truly a bitter pill to swallow, and perhaps Americans may take some solace in the knowledge that the dynamic is not confined to our country. Much of the Western world has been been sitting on a powder keg of increasing diversity in recent years; a string of terror attacks by Islamic extremists and the influx of Syrian refugees has finally provided the spark. Inward­-looking, ethno-­nationalist parties have gained seats across Europe: the Freedom Party in Austria, the Swiss People’s Party in Switzerland, the Danish People’s Party in Denmark, the National Front in France, Jobbik in Hungary, the Finns in Finland, and so forth. The UK has voted to exit the European Union, with voters <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/24/world/europe/making-sense-of-brexit-in-4-charts.html">citing the influx of immigrants</a> ​as the primary reason. In Russia, where the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union provided an earlier spark, far less time was needed to elect a regressive, horseback­-riding demagogue.</p><p>White Americans have for some time maintained the farcical stance that we are the exception to this rule, that we live in a uniquely tolerant, race­-blind utopia. We go to great lengths to preserve this illusion, ignoring the wealth of research showing subconscious discrimination at every level of institutional operation. Ever since the Civil Rights Act outlawed explicit discrimination, the null hypothesis has been that it immediately worked: Innocent until proven guilty.</p><p>Back in 2008, Seth Stephens­-Davidowitz found a gut­-punch of a correlation in U.S. election data. Counties in which Barack Obama underperformed John Kerry, despite outperforming him by 4.6% nationwide, tended to have higher rates of Google searches containing the N­-word. This doesn’t mean that those searching for racial slurs accounted for the discrepancy; rather, it suggests that in counties where racist institutions remain more dominant, this stranglehold manifests itself at both the search box and the ballot box. It seeps into our brains unnoticed, in the guise of correlated values or preferences—perhaps, “he’s weak on terrorism,” or “he doesn’t share my values.” (Consider that 29% of all Americans <a href="http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/23/arsalan-iftikhar/do-59-percent-americans-believe-barack-obama-musli/">believe Obama is a Muslim</a>.​) In his discussion of the results, Stephens-­Davidowitz poignantly referred to John McCain as having had a home-­state advantage in all fifty states.</p><p>At the time, the research was summarily <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/112883/study-racism-cost-obama-millions-votes-unlikely">dismissed as spurious</a> ​by white commentators, many of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/upshot/what-i-got-wrong-about-donald-trump.html">same commentators</a>​ who dramatically miscalled the 2016 GOP race. This primary season, these very same racial­-slur­-searching counties tended to have the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/31/upshot/donald-trumps-strongest-supporters-a-certain-kind-of-democrat.html">highest rates of support</a> ​for a primary candidate who came to political prominence by questioning Obama’s American citizenship. Perhaps it is time to dust off this study and accept its implications.</p><p>I suggest that this is what the commentariat missed: In 2008, the legacy of white supremacist institutions was powerful enough to significantly impact an election; in 2016, with racial tensions peaking, this legacy is powerful enough to define an election.</p><p>But what recognizable public figure could possibly be shameless or oblivious enough to accept this mantle? Who could credibly tell the loser class that they deserve to win, that they c​an​win, through no fault of their own but through the inheritance of vast amounts of privilege? Who could unite Christian quasi-­meritocrats, racially resentful whites, and countercultural reactionaries under a single brand?</p><p><b>Donald Trump is a small man​.</b> He is a megaphone for a cacophony of voices he does not begin to comprehend. His words are the death wails of a power hierarchy he had no hand in erecting but has plastered his name across nonetheless. He speaks in tweets. The mob retweets. We hear the exasperation in Marco Rubio’s voice as he struggles to grasp why his party is lapping at the feet of a blind demagogue. Trump is unthinking. He knows his wife is hotter.</p><p>Trump’s voters have no cohesive platform; they are merely anti. They are anti­-terrorism, anti­-Obama, anti­-Islam, anti­-Clinton, anti­-feminism, anti­-PC, anti­-that crawling sense that something is not quite right with this country. They know exactly what they stand against and they relish any opportunity to applaud the insult comic who cloyingly echoes their sentiments. The clucks­-for­-clicks media loves a good roast.</p><p>This dynamic is entirely lost on Trump. If asked to explain his electoral success, Trump would no doubt credit his own magnetic persona and political prowess. A N​ew York Times​profile of his butler reveals the deep-­seated, pathological character of Trump’s narcissism: Hired yes­ men intentionally exaggerate the length of his golf drive; he gives them hundred­-dollar bills from his pocket. “Is Trump strong?” he smirks. Trump is not a mastermind with his finger on the pulse of the electorate. Indeed, he is not even in on his own con.</p><p>Trump stands for nothing. With a little more courage, he’d stand for white supremacy, patriarchy, Christian nationalism, and primogeniture-­style laissez-­faire capitalism. With a little more knowledge of history, he might welcome the comparisons to Mussolini, Hitler, and other strongmen who called upon their nation­-states to rediscover discomforting ethnicist roots. Fortunately, Trump lacks the brain and the spine to be a fascist.</p><p>Unfortunately, one needn’t be a fascist to cause profound damage to our polity. Trump’s comments on foreign affairs indicate a willingness to engage in overtly colonial wars of resource extraction, abolish the diplomatic ties undergirding the post-­war order, and possibly use nuclear weapons—he's not sure. His disregard for ideology and transactional view of the judiciary would stack the Supreme Court for a generation with buyable sycophants unrestrained by constitutional philosophy. His Putinesque relationship with the press and affinity for spectacle could spell ruin for our fragile news media. He has already made explicit his intention to exclude and deport ethnic and religious minorities. Given the bloated role of the executive in recent administrations, these are all atrocities generally within presidential authority.</p><p>Trump will probably not exterminate Muslim Americans or annex Canada, but when did this become the bar for a major­party candidate?</p><p>Donald Trump’s America is the very definition of a rogue state. His conservative backers must think carefully about whether this path is truly more reversible than four or eight more years of Clintonian gradualism.</p><p>What happens next is in large part up to our media. If they continue to parrot Trump’s filthy, oppressive tripe after his name and a colon, if they continue to frame our choice as between a renegade underdog and the establishment shills, Donald Trump will be our President. His puppeteers will sign executive actions with his limp hands, circumventing a vestigial Congress so festering and rancid that none will defend it in its death throes. Cronies at every rank will distort and censor the opposition, flinging frivolous lawsuits as their vengeful, red-­faced champion taught them. They will deport, they will exclude, they will reject, they will refuse. Oppression will continue. Oppression will worsen.</p><p>If the media seeks to educate rather than entertain, if every article leaves readers wondering how a politically illiterate, racist demagogue is still somehow a candidate for President, we may survive to see another four bitter, toiling years of constitutional tug­-of-­war. There is no such thing as objective reporting on the rise of a tyrant. There is only resistance.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the entire American electorate is on trial this November. Donald Trump is a referendum: Are we committed to the lofty ideals of our nation’s founding, or are we bound by a curse of history to the tribal conflict in which the iron was forged? The centuries speak through us, every one, as we go to the polls. Do not let pride cloud your vision of our past and present; do not blindly trust those beneficiaries of injustice who would have you co­sign the writ of their self-­preservation. Bring to the ballot box a sober knowledge of our history, in all its tragic complexities, lest future generations remember you as another cog in the cruel clockwork of stasis.</p>
