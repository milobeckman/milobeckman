<p>I was selected for a jury a few weeks ago, one of six jurors selected from a group of twenty. (The twenty were picked by lottery.) I noted that twelve of the twenty prospective jurors were white, but all six of us on the jury were white.</p>

<p>The probability of this happening by chance is (12 choose 6) / (20 choose 6) or about 2.4%.</p>

<p>Of course, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batson_v._Kentucky">illegal</a> to dismiss a juror on the basis of race (though only since 1986). But that's extremely hard to enforce:</p>

<p class="quote">In Purkett v. Elm, in 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that any race-neutral reason, no matter how silly, ridiculous, or superstitious, is enough to satisfy the prosecutor’s burden of showing that a pattern of striking a particular racial group is not, in fact, based on race. In that case, the prosecutor offered the following explanation to justify his strikes of black jurors: "I struck [juror] number twenty-two because of his long hair. He had long curly hair. He had the longest hair of anybody on the panel by far. He appeared not to be a good juror for that fact.... Also, he had a mustache and a goatee type beard. And juror number twenty-four also had a mustache and goatee type beard.... And I don’t like the way they looked, with the way the hair is cut, both of them. And the mustaches and the beards look suspicious to me."</p>
