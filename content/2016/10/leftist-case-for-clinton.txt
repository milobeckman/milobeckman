<p>I've posted a <a href="https://medium.com/@milobela/the-leftist-case-for-clinton-c5de3dfd8a67">Medium article</a> by that name, though in all honesty it's more of a millennial case for Clinton. It contains much of what's been said (positively) about her in the past, packaged for a disaffected former Bernie supporter.</p>

<p>This is the piece I would claim as legitimately original, my attempt to summarize her foreign policy doctrine:</p>

[[FOLD]]

<p class="quote">1. &nbsp; <b><i>Hillary Clinton is a liberal transnationalist.</i></b> She believes in the primacy of human rights, particularly of individuals against oppressive governments. She dreams of a future system where nations are encouraged to adhere to international norms by something like the U.N. on steroids. <br><br>
2. &nbsp; <b><i>Hillary Clinton believes in firm commitment to international agreements.</i></b> The only way to bring about this future globalist order, the argument goes, is to honor our present commitments and compel others to do the same. <br><br>
3. &nbsp; <b><i>Hillary Clinton does not see inaction as morally distinct from action.</i></b> As long as you’ve factored in all costs — in lives, dollars, and potential long-term unintended consequences — she believes every viable course of action (including inaction) should be considered on its merits. As with domestic policy, she has little patience for non-interventionist ideologues. <br><br>
4. &nbsp; <b><i>Hillary Clinton equates military might with moral responsibility.</i></b> In the end, she is a cold realist: Whoever has the biggest stick sets the agenda. By shirking international responsibilities, the United States transfers power to the next biggest stick.</p>

Ironically, the article seems most popular among older liberals who are pleased to see a millennial echoing their sentiments (representative forcing).
