<p>New <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/svc/crosswords/v2/puzzle/print/Oct2716.pdf">crossword</a> up today on the New York Times, and it's a kooky one. Solve times coming in at nearly double the average Thursday speeds. Give it a try <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/crosswords/game/daily/2016/10/27">here</a> (NYT login required).</p>

<p>From my constructor's notes on <a href="http://www.xwordinfo.com/Crossword?date=10/27/2016">XWordInfo</a> (spoilers ahead):</p>

<p class="quote">I wanted to make a puzzle where the solution involved leaving some squares blank. My original idea involved theme entries like "RUNNING ON [EMPTY]" and "[NOTHING] PERSONAL" where the Down answers only made sense if you left the bracketed words blank. But Will rejected a couple iterations of this ... So the obvious next step was a puzzle where the Down answers worked as valid entries with OR without the letter from the intersecting theme entry.</p>
