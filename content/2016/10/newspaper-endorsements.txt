<p>This is the question suggested by a chart from my <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-leads-trump-and-obama-and-reagan-in-the-newspaper-endorsement-race/">new FiveThirtyEight post</a>, looking at newspaper endorsements over the last few decades:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0TE5TWYP-I">DW-NOMINATE data</a> suggest the congressional GOP at least has moved right, though what exactly "right" means in the current climate is up for debate.</p>

<p>In researching this piece I read some 30â€“40 newspaper endorsements, and kept an informal tally of common tropes. Nearly every endorsement called Trump racist/xenophobic, dishonest, and "unfit" for the presidency, while Clinton's recurring tropes were her email server, her status as the first woman to receive a major party nomination, and the nebulous criticism that she "is flawed" or "has flaws." This last one stuck out to me.</p>
