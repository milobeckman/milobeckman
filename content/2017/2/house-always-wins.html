                            <p>Here’s an Aesop’s fable:</p>

<p class="quote">The Lion, the Fox and the Stag entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large bounty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Stag to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Stag carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Stag. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, “Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction.” He replied, “I learned it from the Stag, by witnessing his fate.”</p>

<p>There’s no moral to this story. It’s just a thing that happens sometimes. People with power can use their power to grab more power.</p>

<p>Nixon famously secured reelection by bugging DNC headquarters. Far more consequential, though, was how he came to power in the first place: the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">Southern Strategy</a>” which made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ&t=21s">winking promises of racial superiority</a> to Southern whites reeling from the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.</p>

<p>What’s noteworthy here is not just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">policy content</a> but the political mechanism: There existed a desire for stasis among those who were advantaged under the existing order, and so some politician could tap into that, if only he were able to come up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman#War_on_drugs">sanitized justification for regressive policies</a> which would maintain that stasis.</p>

<p>The invisible hand of governance preserves the existing allocation of resources. This is the clockwork of institutional inertia: <mark>Those who prefer the status quo are disproportionately empowered to maintain it.</mark></p>

<p>There are “true conservatives”—Reagans, Rands, Ryans—who genuinely believe the act of redistribution is harmful on principle. But their power is not proportional to the quality of their ideas; it’s proportional to the influence of those who wish to conserve the inherited distribution. They win not because they’re better at blackjack, but because they own the table.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental asymmetry between progressivism and conservatism. The progressive has to coax the lion into sharing the loot. The conservative just has to kill the stag.</p>
