<p>For much of high school, I was an avid member of the <a href=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community>Art of Problem Solving</a> forums, a community for posing and solving contest math problems. Many original problems can be found at <a href=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/user/miyomiyo>my account page</a>; here is one example (original <a href=https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/u19626h346634p1856389>here</a>):</p>

<p class="quote">Segments <i>PA</i> and <i>PB</i> are tangent to circle <i>ω</i> at points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> respectively. Let <i>CD</i> be any diameter of <i>ω</i>. Lines <i>AC</i> and <i>BD</i> intersect at <i>M</i>, and lines <i>AD</i> and <i>BC</i> intersect at <i>N</i>. Prove that <i>PA</i> = <i>PB</i> = <i>PM</i> = <i>PN</i>.</p>
