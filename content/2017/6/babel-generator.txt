<p>Working with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Perelman>Les Perelman</a> and two MIT students, I co-created the BABEL (Basic Automatic Bullshit Essay Language) Generator in 2014. The project was designed to demonstrate that automatic essay scorers, like those used by <a href=https://www.ets.org/>ETS</a> to grade the GRE, are not good judges of writing quality, and instead focus on word length and grammatical complexity. To do this, we "fought robots with robots" -- we created an essay generator that writes a nonsensical essay on any topic, but still receives a perfect score from ETS.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from a sample essay:</p>

Because injunctions which provide those in question are exposed of government, the sedulous government can be more temporarily contemplated. Additionally, recrudescence, normally of postulates, assumes government which might be provision with speculations or lectures. In my experience, none of the utterances to my consequence whine and authenticate an inspection but surprise allegations by textuality.</p>
