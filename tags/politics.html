                            <p>The DNC (~1963-present) has been the most consequential force for domestic progressive change in recent American history.</p>

<p>Agents of the DNC have passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)">Medicare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965">Voting Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Affordable Care Act</a>; have raised taxes on corporate and personal income. These actions have changed the allocation of resources in a real sense, from the wealthy to the disadvantaged, particularly people of color.</p> 

<p>These changes were prompted by, and would not have happened without, activists. But they also would not have happened without institutional actors generally amenable to the activists' ideals. The DNC is responsive to these activists (for whatever reasons, even if it's just for votes) and -- crucially -- they work to develop realistic policies that will address their concerns. These policies are often seen as "incrementalist" especially by the activists who pushed for them, but this is precisely how progressive change has happened in every historical example.</p>

<p>The DNC certainly has problems, but they are more a result of the ecosystem in which the DNC exists than they are specific to the DNC. For example, the DNC is funded by an assortment of interest groups and wealthy donors. This is a feature of the party/election process: if the DNC declined funding from interest groups and wealthy donors, it would lose every election and soon be supplanted by a party that accepted this funding.</p>

<p>How, then, do we change these system-level problems? It's awfully easy to come along and say "this is fucked, right?" It's much harder to come up with workable solutions. We can say "campaign finance reform," but what does that mean? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_elections">Public election funding</a>? <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/donor-diversity-through-public-matching-funds">Small donor matching</a>? these are good, workable solutions -- and they're supported by DNC politicians.</p>

<p><mark>You change system-level problems by supporting those institutional actors (yes, within that problematic system) who support the same changes as you.</mark> Attacking institutions for responding appropriately to systemic incentives -- especially when those institutions are working to change the systemic incentives -- is actively counterproductive.</p>

<p>Essentially, we should measure the DNC (really, we should measure everything) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement">value above replacement</a>. The alternative to the DNC isn't some magical Standing Rock–Black Lives Matter party with no corporate allies. It's the RNC.</p>

                            <p>Coastal educated elites don't like being seen as coastal educated elites. When asked to explain why education is <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/">highly correlated with Clinton support</a> (among white voters) we suggest an assortment of evenhanded theories. Maybe it's about media consumption habits. Maybe it's about cultural hegemony. Even when we suggest that it's about, well, education, there's some hedging:</p>

<p class="quote">Trump’s approach to the campaign — relying on emotional appeals while glossing over policy details — may have resonated more among people with lower education levels as compared with Clinton’s wonkier and more cerebral approach.</p>

<p>(That is from Nate Silver, linked above.)</p>

<p>Let me be more blunt:</p>

<p><mark>Maybe education is correlated with Clinton support because the world takes some explaining.</mark></p>

<p>American lore teaches us from an early age that we live in a meritocracy — that if you work hard, you will get ahead. At the same time, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in poverty. The default response, if you don't know any better, is to assume they have less to offer, or that they are less motivated.</p>

<p>The overwhelming weight of empirical evidence, of course, points to institutional explanations — a long and ongoing history of legal, economic, social, cultural, and political exclusion and oppression. Each study makes up a single pixel of the broader picture. There is no four-word slogan. It can't be tweeted.</p>

<p>But there is broad academic consensus on this point. The debate has been closed. When a politician strays from this consensus, they are shunned — not to preserve some "politically correct" worldview, but because they are wrong.</p>

<p>At no point, though, did we share this knowledge with the non-college-educated public. They feel that their beliefs are shunned, and they dig in their heels. We shun them more. They elect a proud know-nothing who learns from internet messageboards and traffics in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>We need to do better. <mark>Stigmatizing ignorance is an extremely ineffective way to educate people.</mark></p>

                            <p>Imagine you write news that is published online. Yesterday, your intel found that 60% of all social media clicks went to articles about Hamilton, 30% to articles about Trump University, 10% to the nomination of Jeff Sessions. You believe Attorney-General Sessions is the most consequential piece of news. You now face a dilemma: What do you report on?</p>

<p>The answer: It doesn't matter. Whatever you choose, 60% of clicks will go to Hamilton, 30% to Trump University, 10% to Sessions.</p>

<p>The problem is not a supply of fake news, it's a demand for fake news. If not the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo">100 Macedonian websites</a>, someone else would have called Clinton a criminal. The clicks were there. Someone just needed to provide the article.</p>

<p>In other words, <mark>the market for information is freer than ever before, and its revealed preference is that we don't put much of a premium on truth.</mark></p>

<p>If we agree this is problematic, we must either change norms or regulate the market for information. It would be an immense feat to ask 1.8 billion Facebook users to have intentionality about their every click. It seems reasonable to ask Facebook to play the role of regulator here.</p>

<p>This means hiring not just journalists and editors, but sociologists, economists, political scientists. It means writing algorithms whose bottom line is the public interest. It means losing clicks. It will not be in Facebook's self-interest to do this unless we as users pressure them to do so — perhaps by boycotting if they do not.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley has faith in the free market. Whether a private company can step up to the plate and stem the tide of misinformation/distraction will be an excellent test of this faith.</p>

                            <p><i>This piece was written around February–March 2016, near the end of the Republican primaries. A shorter, post-election version is available <a href="https://medium.com/@milobela/institutional-inertia-in-the-birther-era-341c41179c2a#.bs13sxrsu">here</a>.</i></p>

<p class="b2">1.</p><p><b>This election season is not quite​</b> like anything we’ve seen; beyond this, pundits agree on rather little. That politicians, donors, journalists, strategists, and academics all misread the American electorate last summer is now obvious. What exactly we got wrong, though, is not.</p><p>Here’s what we know: A plurality of voters in the party of Lincoln desire as their president a brash, xenophobic narcissist with the temperament and political experience of a middle schooler. This bloc defies simple categorization but is most densely concentrated in areas with low educational attainment among whites, high rates of evangelical Christianity, and significant presence of racial minorities (who, to a first approximation, do not participate in Republican primaries). The movement’s core voters are joined by a sizable chunk of nearly every demographic group in the GOP, as well as a number of Independents and Democrats, in supporting a candidate who has elicited comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Wallace, and Benito Mussolini.</p><p>Here’s what we don’t know: Why is this happening? It is difficult to ascertain exactly what this grassroots movement wants; to the extent that they demand specific policies, they tend to range from incoherent to unconscionable. More often, these Americans seem driven by what they see as a compelling brand: Exclusionary white Christian nationalism, humiliating comeuppance for cosmopolitan elites, the end of political correctness, and myopically unilateral big stick diplomacy. Somewhere in there, too, is the personal appeal of a tremendously wealthy man who appears to succeed without even trying, a man who was not anointed by the ruling political class and who plays by his own rules whether you like it or not.</p>

                            <p>This is the question suggested by a chart from my <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-leads-trump-and-obama-and-reagan-in-the-newspaper-endorsement-race/">new FiveThirtyEight post</a>, looking at newspaper endorsements over the last few decades:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0TE5TWYP-I">DW-NOMINATE data</a> suggest the congressional GOP at least has moved right, though what exactly "right" means in the current climate is up for debate.</p>

<p>In researching this piece I read some 30–40 newspaper endorsements, and kept an informal tally of common tropes. Nearly every endorsement called Trump racist/xenophobic, dishonest, and "unfit" for the presidency, while Clinton's recurring tropes were her email server, her status as the first woman to receive a major party nomination, and the nebulous criticism that she "is flawed" or "has flaws." This last one stuck out to me.</p>

It contains much of what's been said (positively) about her in the past, packaged for a disaffected former Bernie supporter.</p>

<p>This is the piece I would claim as legitimately original, my attempt to summarize her foreign policy doctrine:</p>

Voters of color, of course, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/20/three-in-four-voters-of-color-strongly-dislike-trump/">decided resoundingly against</a> Trump.</p>

<p>It's not central to the piece, but this is a significant point:</p>

<p class="quote">Republican ideology seems to be aligned with the values taught in historically white churches: For instance, black and Hispanic members of interracial congregations hold the same <a href="http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/28/socrel.sru067">individualistic social attitudes</a> as white churchgoers, suggesting that they may adopt these conservative views after extended exposure to white church values.</p>

<p>The linked study is to me an elegant demonstration of institutional inertia: values/practices remain largely stable, despite personnel changes. Consider this in conjunction with the fact that most of America's interracial institutions are historically white — black churches, schools, and neighborhoods have not been integrated.</p>

                            <p>When Justice Antonin Scalia passed away last Saturday, political commentators wasted little time on eulogies. And while the influential jurist certainly deserves a moment of memorializing, the press can hardly be faulted for focusing on his successor. The battle currently raging over Scalia’s replacement will have an impact on American democracy lasting decades beyond his death.</p>
