                            <p><i>This piece was written around February–March 2016, near the end of the Republican primaries. A shorter, post-election version is available <a href="https://medium.com/@milobela/institutional-inertia-in-the-birther-era-341c41179c2a#.bs13sxrsu">here</a>.</i></p>

<p class="b2">1.</p><p><b>This election season is not quite​</b> like anything we’ve seen; beyond this, pundits agree on rather little. That politicians, donors, journalists, strategists, and academics all misread the American electorate last summer is now obvious. What exactly we got wrong, though, is not.</p><p>Here’s what we know: A plurality of voters in the party of Lincoln desire as their president a brash, xenophobic narcissist with the temperament and political experience of a middle schooler. This bloc defies simple categorization but is most densely concentrated in areas with low educational attainment among whites, high rates of evangelical Christianity, and significant presence of racial minorities (who, to a first approximation, do not participate in Republican primaries). The movement’s core voters are joined by a sizable chunk of nearly every demographic group in the GOP, as well as a number of Independents and Democrats, in supporting a candidate who has elicited comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Wallace, and Benito Mussolini.</p><p>Here’s what we don’t know: Why is this happening? It is difficult to ascertain exactly what this grassroots movement wants; to the extent that they demand specific policies, they tend to range from incoherent to unconscionable. More often, these Americans seem driven by what they see as a compelling brand: Exclusionary white Christian nationalism, humiliating comeuppance for cosmopolitan elites, the end of political correctness, and myopically unilateral big stick diplomacy. Somewhere in there, too, is the personal appeal of a tremendously wealthy man who appears to succeed without even trying, a man who was not anointed by the ruling political class and who plays by his own rules whether you like it or not.</p>

                            <p>My <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/religion-and-education-explain-the-white-vote/">new piece</a> on FiveThirtyEight asks this question. Voters of color, of course, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/06/20/three-in-four-voters-of-color-strongly-dislike-trump/">decided resoundingly against</a> Trump.</p>

<p>It's not central to the piece, but this is a significant point:</p>

<p class="quote">Republican ideology seems to be aligned with the values taught in historically white churches: For instance, black and Hispanic members of interracial congregations hold the same <a href="http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/01/28/socrel.sru067">individualistic social attitudes</a> as white churchgoers, suggesting that they may adopt these conservative views after extended exposure to white church values.</p>

<p>The linked study is to me an elegant demonstration of institutional inertia: values/practices remain largely stable, despite personnel changes. Consider this in conjunction with the fact that most of America's interracial institutions are historically white — black churches, schools, and neighborhoods have not been integrated.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/religion-and-education-explain-the-white-vote/">full article</a> for some neat charts.</p>
