                            <p>(All, for obvious reasons, election-themed.)</p>

<p>The short read, <a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/800016844417593345">a paragraph on censorship in the 21st century</a> by Zeynep Tufekci.</p>

<p class="quote">Think of attention as a resource ... and censorship as a broad term for denial of attention through multiple means, including but not limited to the traditional definition of censorship as efforts to actively block information from getting out.</p>

<p>The medium read, <a href="http://farai.com/the-call-to-whiteness/">an essay on the politics of whiteness</a> by Farai Chideya.</p>

<p class="quote">In retrospect, I realize ... how unwilling I and we were as journalists to foreground this clash over the nationalist call-to-whiteness as part of the political narrative. This horrified mother was staring white nationalism in the face, and it was staring back at her.</p>

<p class="quote">There has been a concerted effort — covert, overt, or both — to keep the narrative of white nationalism, including its violence and extralegal workings — out of the American eye. Much of it, I believe, comes from the inability of media and of many individuals to ascribe racial/group characteristics to whiteness.</p>

<p class="quote">I am rejecting ... the idea that my excellence and self-improvement is a blood price I must pay to prove black Americans’ worthiness of a true meritocracy. You either believe in working toward a true meritocracy or you do not, and I will not bribe you into belief by my individual performance. Are you for equality, or are you not?</p>

<p>The long read, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency">a feature on Obama's thoughts after the election</a> by David Remnick.</p>

<p class="quote">“People are complicated,” Obama told me. “Societies and cultures are really complicated. . . . This is not mathematics; this is biology and chemistry. These are living organisms, and it’s messy. And your job as a citizen and as a decent human being is to constantly affirm and lift up and fight for treating people with kindness and respect and understanding. And you should anticipate that at any given moment there’s going to be flare-ups of bigotry that you may have to confront, or may be inside you and you have to vanquish. And it doesn’t stop. . . . You don’t get into a fetal position about it. You don’t start worrying about apocalypse. You say, O.K., where are the places where I can push to keep it moving forward.”</p>

<p>All are excellent pieces of writing and worth your time.</p>

                            <p>Coastal educated elites don't like being seen as coastal educated elites. When asked to explain why education is <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/education-not-income-predicted-who-would-vote-for-trump/">highly correlated with Clinton support</a> (among white voters) we suggest an assortment of evenhanded theories. Maybe it's about media consumption habits. Maybe it's about cultural hegemony. Even when we suggest that it's about, well, education, there's some hedging:</p>

<p class="quote">Trump’s approach to the campaign — relying on emotional appeals while glossing over policy details — may have resonated more among people with lower education levels as compared with Clinton’s wonkier and more cerebral approach.</p>

<p>(That is from Nate Silver, linked above.)</p>

<p>Let me be more blunt:</p>

<p><mark>Maybe education is correlated with Clinton support because the world takes some explaining.</mark></p>

<p>American lore teaches us from an early age that we live in a meritocracy — that if you work hard, you will get ahead. At the same time, blacks and Hispanics are more likely than whites to live in poverty. The default response, if you don't know any better, is to assume they have less to offer, or that they are less motivated.</p>

<p>The overwhelming weight of empirical evidence, of course, points to institutional explanations — a long and ongoing history of legal, economic, social, cultural, and political exclusion and oppression. Each study makes up a single pixel of the broader picture. There is no four-word slogan. It can't be tweeted.</p>

<p>But there is broad academic consensus on this point. The debate has been closed. When a politician strays from this consensus, they are shunned — not to preserve some "politically correct" worldview, but because they are wrong.</p>

<p>At no point, though, did we share this knowledge with the non-college-educated public. They feel that their beliefs are shunned, and they dig in their heels. We shun them more. They elect a proud know-nothing who learns from internet messageboards and traffics in conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>We need to do better. <mark>Stigmatizing ignorance is an extremely ineffective way to educate people.</mark></p>

                            <p>Imagine you write news that is published online. Yesterday, your intel found that 60% of all social media clicks went to articles about Hamilton, 30% to articles about Trump University, 10% to the nomination of Jeff Sessions. You believe Attorney-General Sessions is the most consequential piece of news. You now face a dilemma: What do you report on?</p>

<p>The answer: It doesn't matter. Whatever you choose, 60% of clicks will go to Hamilton, 30% to Trump University, 10% to Sessions.</p>

<p>The problem is not a supply of fake news, it's a demand for fake news. If not the <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/how-macedonia-became-a-global-hub-for-pro-trump-misinfo">100 Macedonian websites</a>, someone else would have called Clinton a criminal. The clicks were there. Someone just needed to provide the article.</p>

<p>In other words, <mark>the market for information is freer than ever before, and its revealed preference is that we don't put much of a premium on truth.</mark></p>

<p>If we agree this is problematic, we must either change norms or regulate the market for information. It would be an immense feat to ask 1.8 billion Facebook users to have intentionality about their every click. It seems reasonable to ask Facebook to play the role of regulator here.</p>

<p>This means hiring not just journalists and editors, but sociologists, economists, political scientists. It means writing algorithms whose bottom line is the public interest. It means losing clicks. It will not be in Facebook's self-interest to do this unless we as users pressure them to do so — perhaps by boycotting if they do not.</p>

<p>Silicon Valley has faith in the free market. Whether a private company can step up to the plate and stem the tide of misinformation/distraction will be an excellent test of this faith.</p>

                            <p>I was selected for a jury a few weeks ago, one of six jurors selected from a group of twenty. (The twenty were picked by lottery.) I noted that twelve of the twenty prospective jurors were white, but all six of us on the jury were white.</p>

<p>The probability of this happening by chance is (12 choose 6) / (20 choose 6) or about 2.4%.</p>

<p>Of course, it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batson_v._Kentucky">illegal</a> to dismiss a juror on the basis of race (though only since 1986). But that's extremely hard to enforce:</p>

<p class="quote">In Purkett v. Elm, in 1995, the Supreme Court ruled that any race-neutral reason, no matter how silly, ridiculous, or superstitious, is enough to satisfy the prosecutor’s burden of showing that a pattern of striking a particular racial group is not, in fact, based on race. In that case, the prosecutor offered the following explanation to justify his strikes of black jurors: "I struck [juror] number twenty-two because of his long hair. He had long curly hair. He had the longest hair of anybody on the panel by far. He appeared not to be a good juror for that fact.... Also, he had a mustache and a goatee type beard. And juror number twenty-four also had a mustache and goatee type beard.... And I don’t like the way they looked, with the way the hair is cut, both of them. And the mustaches and the beards look suspicious to me."</p>

<p>That's from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Jim-Crow-Incarceration-Colorblindness/dp/1595586431/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1479497017&sr=8-1&keywords=the+new+jim+crow">Michelle Alexander</a>. Note also that Manhattan is only 58.9% white.</p>

<p class="b2">1.</p><p><b>This election season is not quite​</b> like anything we’ve seen; beyond this, pundits agree on rather little. That politicians, donors, journalists, strategists, and academics all misread the American electorate last summer is now obvious. What exactly we got wrong, though, is not.</p><p>Here’s what we know: A plurality of voters in the party of Lincoln desire as their president a brash, xenophobic narcissist with the temperament and political experience of a middle schooler. This bloc defies simple categorization but is most densely concentrated in areas with low educational attainment among whites, high rates of evangelical Christianity, and significant presence of racial minorities (who, to a first approximation, do not participate in Republican primaries). The movement’s core voters are joined by a sizable chunk of nearly every demographic group in the GOP, as well as a number of Independents and Democrats, in supporting a candidate who has elicited comparisons to Teddy Roosevelt, Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Wallace, and Benito Mussolini.</p><p>Here’s what we don’t know: Why is this happening? It is difficult to ascertain exactly what this grassroots movement wants; to the extent that they demand specific policies, they tend to range from incoherent to unconscionable. More often, these Americans seem driven by what they see as a compelling brand: Exclusionary white Christian nationalism, humiliating comeuppance for cosmopolitan elites, the end of political correctness, and myopically unilateral big stick diplomacy. Somewhere in there, too, is the personal appeal of a tremendously wealthy man who appears to succeed without even trying, a man who was not anointed by the ruling political class and who plays by his own rules whether you like it or not.</p>

                            <p>This is the question suggested by a chart from my <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-leads-trump-and-obama-and-reagan-in-the-newspaper-endorsement-race/">new FiveThirtyEight post</a>, looking at newspaper endorsements over the last few decades:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0TE5TWYP-I">DW-NOMINATE data</a> suggest the congressional GOP at least has moved right, though what exactly "right" means in the current climate is up for debate.</p>

<p>In researching this piece I read some 30–40 newspaper endorsements, and kept an informal tally of common tropes. Nearly every endorsement called Trump racist/xenophobic, dishonest, and "unfit" for the presidency, while Clinton's recurring tropes were her email server, her status as the first woman to receive a major party nomination, and the nebulous criticism that she "is flawed" or "has flaws." This last one stuck out to me.</p>

It contains much of what's been said (positively) about her in the past, packaged for a disaffected former Bernie supporter.</p>

<p>This is the piece I would claim as legitimately original, my attempt to summarize her foreign policy doctrine:</p>
