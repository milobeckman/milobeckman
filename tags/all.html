                            <p>Working with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Perelman>Les Perelman</a> and two MIT students, I co-created the BABEL (Basic Automatic Bullshit Essay Language) Generator in 2014. The project was designed to demonstrate that automatic essay scorers, like those used by <a href=https://www.ets.org/>ETS</a> to grade the GRE, are not good judges of writing quality, and instead focus on word length and grammatical complexity. To do this, we "fought robots with robots" -- we created an essay generator that writes a nonsensical essay on any topic, but still receives a perfect score from ETS.</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from a sample essay:</p>

<p class="quote">The circumspection that is benevolently assented, especially for culpability, should compensate engineering which civilizes assimilationists. Because injunctions which provide those in question are exposed of government, the sedulous government can be more temporarily contemplated. Additionally, recrudescence, normally of postulates, assumes government which might be provision with speculations or lectures. In my experience, none of the utterances to my consequence whine and authenticate an inspection but surprise allegations by textuality.</p>

You give it a list of "bad websites" and it makes you wait 15 seconds before entering. It's a simple fix, but it's increased my productivity noticeably.</p>

                            <p>Here’s an Aesop’s fable:</p>

<p class="quote">The Lion, the Fox and the Stag entered into an agreement to assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large bounty, the Lion on their return from the forest asked the Stag to allot his due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Stag carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion, bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Stag. Then he requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The Fox accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, “Who has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division? You are perfect to a fraction.” He replied, “I learned it from the Stag, by witnessing his fate.”</p>

<p>There’s no moral to this story. It’s just a thing that happens sometimes. People with power can use their power to grab more power.</p>

<p>Nixon famously secured reelection by bugging DNC headquarters. Far more consequential, though, was how he came to power in the first place: the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy">Southern Strategy</a>” which made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_8E3ENrKrQ&t=21s">winking promises of racial superiority</a> to Southern whites reeling from the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.</p>

<p>What’s noteworthy here is not just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_on_Drugs">policy content</a> but the political mechanism: There existed a desire for stasis among those who were advantaged under the existing order, and so some politician could tap into that, if only he were able to come up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ehrlichman#War_on_drugs">sanitized justification for regressive policies</a> which would maintain that stasis.</p>

<p>The invisible hand of governance preserves the existing allocation of resources. This is the clockwork of institutional inertia: <mark>Those who prefer the status quo are disproportionately empowered to maintain it.</mark></p>

<p>There are “true conservatives”—Reagans, Rands, Ryans—who genuinely believe the act of redistribution is harmful on principle. But their power is not proportional to the quality of their ideas; it’s proportional to the influence of those who wish to conserve the inherited distribution. They win not because they’re better at blackjack, but because they own the table.</p>

<p>This is the fundamental asymmetry between progressivism and conservatism. The progressive has to coax the lion into sharing the loot. The conservative just has to kill the stag.</p>

                            <p>The DNC (~1963-present) has been the most consequential force for domestic progressive change in recent American history.</p>

<p>Agents of the DNC have passed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)">Medicare</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid">Medicaid</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964">Civil Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965">Voting Rights Act</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Affordable Care Act</a>; have raised taxes on corporate and personal income. These actions have changed the allocation of resources in a real sense, from the wealthy to the disadvantaged, particularly people of color.</p> 

<p>These changes were prompted by, and would not have happened without, activists. But they also would not have happened without institutional actors generally amenable to the activists' ideals. The DNC is responsive to these activists (for whatever reasons, even if it's just for votes) and -- crucially -- they work to develop realistic policies that will address their concerns. These policies are often seen as "incrementalist" especially by the activists who pushed for them, but this is precisely how progressive change has happened in every historical example.</p>

<p>The DNC certainly has problems, but they are more a result of the ecosystem in which the DNC exists than they are specific to the DNC. For example, the DNC is funded by an assortment of interest groups and wealthy donors. This is a feature of the party/election process: if the DNC declined funding from interest groups and wealthy donors, it would lose every election and soon be supplanted by a party that accepted this funding.</p>

<p>How, then, do we change these system-level problems? It's awfully easy to come along and say "this is fucked, right?" It's much harder to come up with workable solutions. We can say "campaign finance reform," but what does that mean? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publicly_funded_elections">Public election funding</a>? <a href="http://www.brennancenter.org/publication/donor-diversity-through-public-matching-funds">Small donor matching</a>? These are good, workable solutions -- and they're supported by DNC politicians.</p>

<p><mark>You change system-level problems by supporting those institutional actors (yes, within that problematic system) who support the same changes as you.</mark> Attacking institutions for responding appropriately to systemic incentives -- especially when those institutions are working to change the systemic incentives -- is actively counterproductive.</p>

<p>Essentially, we should measure the DNC (really, we should measure everything) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement">value above replacement</a>. The alternative to the DNC isn't some magical Standing Rock–Black Lives Matter party with no corporate allies. It's the RNC.</p>
